While pairing with [@wesgibbs](http://twitter.com/wesgibbs) on a project at
[hashrocket](http://www.hashrocket.com), we got in the habbit of 'testing'
our migrations by doing the following:


{% highlight sh %}
    rake db:migrate db:migrate:redo db:test:prepare
{% endhighlight %}

At some point; frazzled and dealing with a migration that kept breaking while
running the above, I uttered: "db-db-db", which was subsequently flipped around
to "bidi-bidi-bidi". Now, as a proud (well, kinda) son of the 80's, my mind went
immediately to [Pamela Hensley](http://www.pamela-hensley.com/)&hellip; and soon
thereafter, to [Twiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiki) of
[Buck Rodgers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078579/) and his
[perennial tag line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS7MGflCbW0).

And so the following shell script was born (Mac only, sorry windozers):

{% highlight sh %}
    twiki () {
      say -v Zarvox 'beedee-beedee-beedee'
      rake db:migrate && rake db:migrate:redo && rake db:test:prepare
    }
{% endhighlight %}

The speed and voice aren't quite right, but the sheer cheese factor cracks me up
on the regular, so I figured I'd spread the wealth ;)
